# my-first-app
My first angular app

This app is based on the MEAN Stack tutorial by edureka! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ3MMIv3AQY

The base is a mailserver setup including Postfix, Dovecot and Mysql on Ubuntu 18.04 inspired by a blog post from Thomas Leister 
https://thomas-leister.de/mailserver-unter-ubuntu-16.04/ (German)

This is a simple user- and domain management web console where you can add/delete users and domains. German language only!
